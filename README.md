## Features

- **Metadata scraping**: recognize video codes, read NFO files and fill titles, performers, studios and covers from multiple sources while keeping your edits.
- **Local and cloud libraries**: browse local drives, SMB, mounted cloud storage and PikPak libraries together.
- **Playback and history**: web and external players, subtitles, playback speed, rotation, resume and timeline previews.
- **Follows and discovery**: track performer and creator updates, discover titles and manage a want list.
- **Cloud download**: search by video code or submit a magnet link, then organize completed downloads into your library.
- **Library management**: manage tags, duplicates, versions and parts; permanently delete videos by performer while keeping profiles and photos. Metadata and watch history are stored locally.
- **Task center**: pause, resume or cancel local background tasks and view their CPU, GPU and download activity where available.
- **Guided tours**: learn the interface and settings as needed; tutorial progress is shared across devices connected to the same instance.
